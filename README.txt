Procnanny is a simple program that will monitor specified processes to ensure
that they do not run for longer than a specified time. These parameters can
be specified in a text file with the name of each process to be monitored
followed by the maximum allowable duration for that process in seconds. The
location of this configuration file should be passed as the first and only
argument to procnanny.

In order to run procnanny, first navigate to the folder containing the
included file called 'Makefile' and 'procnanny.c'. Run the command 'make' and
an executable called 'procnanny should be created. Run this executable with
the location of the configuration file as the first argument.
